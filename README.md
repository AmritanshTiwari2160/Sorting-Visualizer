# DSA Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Sorting Visualizer** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The visualizer allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time, making it easier to understand and compare their behaviors and performance.

## Features

- Visualizes popular sorting algorithms including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
    
- Interactive and user-friendly interface to:
  - Select the sorting algorithm
  - Adjust sorting speed
  - Customize array size and range
  - View step-by-step execution of each algorithm
  
- Real-time updates of array elements, showing how the elements are compared and swapped during sorting.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the web page
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for implementing sorting algorithms and dynamic visualization
